# four-card-feature-section

Initially, I used the 'translate' property to position the cards to achieve the required layout. This method was a bit straining because I had to play around with the position coordinates in order to achieve the layout.

A better solution was using Grid to solve the layout design which was much simpler, easier and more precise.
